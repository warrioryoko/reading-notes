So, I read this.

The URLSearchParams syntax is clear as mud, and I'm just going to have to see Dani use it.

for (const [key, value] of mySearchParams) {}
for (const [key, value] of mySearchParams.entries()) {}

Saying that these two lines are equivalent is what makes it really confusing, and I really freaking wish they'd didn't do it and conveyed it a different way. Absolutely unhelpful, I fail the writer of these docs.

the .toString() method of this method lets us prettify whatever we have into a string that's useable for our 'build a bear'.

My understanding of .location is, this is our main 'build a bear' tool, allowing us to construct a URL based off of well-named JavaScript elements.

onhashchange? I'll have to see Dani use it to see WHERE and WHY this is useful.
