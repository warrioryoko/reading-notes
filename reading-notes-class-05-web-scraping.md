There's a couple HTTP clients to choose from.

Axios and Superagent - which we've been using. Doesn't seem to be any appreciable *syntactic* difference between the two, and the code I'd write to make a request.

Oh - I'm so sick of people tossing around the word "Syntactic sugar" unnecessarily, that I may just hunt down and slap the next person I read using it. It's not cool, it gets old.

The lesson about regular expressions, always seems to be to NOT use regular expressions, for some reason.

Why can't JQuery just die? Cheerio is a DOM traversal tool using a similar syntax as JQuery, and not appropriate for modern sites/SPAs.

I like the syntax of JSDOM much better than Cheerio. JSDOM gives you DOM manipulation, within Node.

God, why would you use any of those, if you can use Puppeteer or Nightmare? These are more useful, higher level abstractions that create mini-browser instances to interact with.

Puppeteer's syntax looks REALLY clean. Why wouldn't you just use that?
