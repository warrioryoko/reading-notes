The CSS animation demos are interesting; the pure bounce animation is pretty awesome.

It seems like timing, duration and delay are the key common properties between transitions and animations.

Transformation seems to be all about changing or warping positioning. I wasn't impressed with most of it, but the manipulating the perspective and 3d transformations seemed REALLY appealing. These both make the element stand out, rather than make it look like you took a 2d box and made it walk through a carnival house of mirrors.
