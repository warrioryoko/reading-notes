I read the tutorial blurbs.

We use 'returning' to report back what was inserted within an 'insert' statement.

Do not use *, explicitly select what you want. Semi-colons end a SQL statement.

It seems like the 'where' specifier is always optional.

Don't forget to specify an id or other UNIQUE identifier when deleting. "Delete from links;" will nix the whole table.

I skimmed through the 'inside of a computer' link. I've been building computers for a very long time now, including professionally.
