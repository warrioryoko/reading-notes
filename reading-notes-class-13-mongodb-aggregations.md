So, I just read a couple of documentation links about aggregation pipelines in MongoDB.

Great; did you really mean to assign this to us?

Aggregation pipelines allow us to make an set of transformations or filters, input as an array, onto a set of data.

We can match documents we want by criteria, group it by subset and perform transformations on the result. So we could match by transaction date, group by id, and display the transaction amounts.
