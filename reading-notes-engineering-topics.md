"Quantity trumps quality" teaches the lesson that quality comes only FROM quantity. The only way to get better and produce quality, is to do, do, and do more. Rather than "slow down" and try to do it "better".

Clean Code's first chapter makes the overall impression to me that I need to think of myself as an author. You cannot write code, without reading it. Without reading plenty of it - the ratio of reading code to actually writing it is HUGE. So, readability of code is of paramount importance. Think of the idea and requirement you are trying to fulfill.

TDD Red Green Refactor and Cycles of TDD both express the same idea to different levels of detail. Let your tests drive your development. Start with a test that will actually fail if it does not meet the requirement. Write the minimum amount of code required to get the test to pass. Then allow the passing test and messy code drive your design phase, where you refactor and really understand how you are solving the problem.

These were all good reads. The Clean Code chapter, however, was REALLY good reading. To the extent, that I'm ordering a copy of that book and others the author recommends.
