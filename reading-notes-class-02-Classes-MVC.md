Arrays

I'm going to keep the Array Method Cheat Sheet, and the Array Methods blog post around. There were some methods I didn't know existed, such as .some(), .every(), .from(), and .of()

Classes

My eyes just glaze over once we start getting knee-deep into classes, and I don't think there's anything you can do to fix that.

Besides having to extend classes in libraries or frameworks, I don't really understand why I would want to use classes when writing an application. I don't see what it offers that isn't better done through other methods, such as function composition. I don't want to be a Java or C# programmer! That's why I moved from St. Louis and came here.

Yes, there's a lot of implementation details. Probably the most relevant one I'm having difficulty understanding is the real use of super, especially with modern React.

MVC

Yeah, this is a design pattern we'll use. Modularity, separation of concerns, and all that. I get it.
