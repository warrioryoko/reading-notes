I'd been living a lie my entire life, up until now! I was operating under the understanding that Al Gore created the internet. Not so! Roy Fielding is one of the people who wrote the REST protocol, which is largely responsible for the internet functioning as the internet.

It's also clearly not a series of tubes - it's a series of RESTs.

Wow. I don't think I'll ever forget "shmet the bottle", "mandle the magazine", and "zorp the book". I also challenge the notion that I can't drive a cup, or drink a car.

Hmm. Very interesting. It's all about using common verbs, on nouns. That's what REST is - a common vocubalary for computers.

Also, superagent is a thing. It seems to have all of the same HTTP verbs, and has query params as a built in feature.
