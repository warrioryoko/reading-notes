I read the thing.

The tutorials for PostgreSQL joins were actually very clear and helpful, in comparision to the tutorials we read in Foundations II.

Because these tutorials provided both the code, and the contents of the returned table for each join query.

Okay, different cardinality relationships. Check.

One brain per person, many children to one mother, multiple authors to multiple books, including co-authoring the same titles.

Got it.
