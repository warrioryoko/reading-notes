The essence of what I get from reading the articles are a few things.

That encryption algorithms + salts that SCALE in computational complexity, or time to complete the computation are absolutely necessary. As we must assume that all encryption can and will be broken given a connection and enough time, we have to normalize the time it takes to crack encryption as computing hardware power increases. The bcrypt algorithm does this, by having variable length/computational complexity hashes + salts or "cost" which exponentionally increase the amount of time it takes to crack. This is the number of times the password is encrypted, using different encryption keys.

The other thing absolutely require for security, is multi-factor authentication. This adds a random set of encrypted key values onto the authentication state or password, based on a session interaction. So, RSA for example, requires a separate user name and password to generate a random encryption code that changes every 60 seconds, which is then added into a portal's ordinary user name and password. It's one form of a token, OAuth is another form of a token - a JavaScript Web Token, which is stored/tracked in the web browser's memory.
