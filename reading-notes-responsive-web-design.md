Build web sites to work/adjust to every screen size, browser and device type.

Responsive web design - react quickly to changes. Adaptive web design - easily modified or changed. Mobile web design - a separate web app for mobile device users.

Make a flexible, relative grid that can be resized. But using percentages, let alone percents with 7 trailing digits is really freaking weird and just NO - how do you even?!

Media Queries seem to be the way to get specific information about the type of SCREEN or view properties of the user, and get really specific about the size range allowable for what the page itself will display, so that you can make that flexible grid.

Using mobile first design, you will make VERY ugly sites that often look like they were designed for a see-and-say phone. But hey, you have only what interactable elements you need and everything fits on the screen properly, right?

Viewport seems to be a godsend.

Why didn't anyone just say, "Hey doofus, make sure your elements have a max width set to 100%, so you stuff doesn't take up more space than the viewable window!"

Chris Coyier is the float whisperer. I didn't understand that floated elements have a virtual height of zero!

Can we PLEASE not include a ton of base CSS manipulation and CSS Grid? And use fixed pixel size gutters, I guess?

WHERE has the clear property been all of my life? Why didn't anyone ever tell me about clear so that you could actually make multiple floats work?!
