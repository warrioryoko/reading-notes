HTML Chapter 16

You can control the height and width of images using CSS. Better to do it from there, than HTML tag properties.

Using margin: auto can be helpful for trying to center images.

Use background-image to put all of your cool collected internet images as a background onto HTML elements. Use background-repeat and background-attachment to detrmine whether a background image should remain visible with scrolling or not. background-position can be used with different tile locations to set where a background image should go. Really though, use the shorthand 'background' and add these properties to it.

You can use pseudo-classes to change an image to a different styling on mouse rollover. Gradients can be assigned to backgrounds. Probably leave this to a designer, or use photoshop to find out exactly what this looks like. Also, don't use overlay text on an image with high contrast.
