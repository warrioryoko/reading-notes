The Diversity in Tech website is awesome! I want to learn how to make a layout like that. The information is interesting, I wonder where it's pulled from and when it was compiled. Is it updated?

The Quartz article makes some really... interesting assertions. I definitely agree that marketing *matters*.

Finally, the most important concept I want to highlight and mark in the margin for the usatoday article is that of "allowing the best idea to win". This may or may not be true or valid within companies, but it's 100% true when it comes to sales markets, logistics, etc.

And to that point, the article makes an incredible point of our backgrounds being a large part of our bias - we cannot see or change this. So, having people with diverse backgrounds I feel addresses this, and is likely why companies are starting to seek out people with non-traditional backgrounds for professional roles. You don't know what you aren't seeing, until you see it!
