HTML Chapter 6

Tables are the spawn of the devil in HTML, and nobody should use them ever. They will never position correctly regardless of what CSS you use.

You can create tables using the table tag, followed by tr for rows, and td (table data) for individual ceels nested in the rows. th makes bold headings for tables. The colspan and rowspan properties allow you to stretch columns and rows to take up more than one "cell" of the table.

thead, tbody and tfoot supposedly make long tables, but never work the way they're supposed to.

Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is mocking your data after a real-world phenomena or concept. And it seems like it's a good idea, at least until you read the article and how it talks about epic fail videos.

The article doesn't really seem to talk about Domain Modeling, so much as it's a sales pitch for constructor functions.

JS Chapter 3

You can create a constructor (function? object?) by using the 'new' keyword to declare it. Then, you can add properties and methods using dot notation - and the 'this' keyword that only Kyle Simpson understands.

Arrays are objects, and have built-in methods. We can (and will) use arrays to store objects.

The Document Object Model or DOM is a respresentation of all of the HTML elements displayed in the Window object. We use the Document object already, to select and manipulate elements. This is DOM Manipulation.

There are Global Objects within the browser to: this gives us access to our String, Number, Math, and Date objects and methods.

It doesn't feel useful for me to repeat the implementation details for every given object or function here. I've read it, but just copying and pasting - or re-typing out - seems like a meaningless exercise in rote memorization that won't work, and we don't need.
