So, I read this.

From what I hear, Regex's are pretty unreadabe to most people, and there's a ton of ways you can use them to do the same thing.

I don't want to use them if I don't have to.

Specifically, because having to rewrite any piece of code that uses them is PROBABLY going to be more of a bear to do than it's worth!

The medium.com article/cheatsheet on regexes is accessible. The other two sites..? You actually expect anyone to be able to read and interact with that? The regexr.com site isn't bad as a playground, I guess. Not so much for that regex101.com
