##HTML Chapter 1

#A bunch of stuff we hopefully know already.

	*HTML is a text document language. It consists of elements that identify how info should be layed out - and to an extent how it appears - in a document.
These elements are placed using tags, enveloping an abbreviation of the element with angle brackets. Tags frequently have attributes, consisting of a name
and value that give information about the element or JavaScript hooks.

	*Body, head, and title tags were covered. Everything that is visible on the main 'box' or page goes in the body. The head contains info about the page that doesn't
appear in the viewable 'box', that is relevant to how the code of the page is processed. The title shows up in the tab of the browser.

##HTML Chapter 8

History of HTML that will never show up on any relevant test, but takes up a couple pages.

	*Doctype goes at the top of an HTML file, and is probably never going to be anything other than HTML or HTML5.

	*Comments look like this: <!-- --> and probably shouldn't be used like JavaScript code comments.

	*Id and Class attributes are global, and used with JavaScript and CSS to select and/or style unique elements/tags, or categories of elements/tags.

	*Block elements appear on a new line, Inline elements do not - they appear like a sentence does, and potentially wraps the elements.

	*Divs group things in a Block element sort of way, Spans group things in an Inline element sort of way.

	*I have never seen an iframe outside of google map windows, and I'm not sure I want to.

	*The meta tag contains information about your webpage that seem to mostly be relevant for Search Engine Optimization, and caching. Also, there are characters that
are 'escaped' like copyright and monetary denomination symbols.

##HTML Chapter 17

Use your HTML5 elements, kids.

	*Doctors say that a healthy diet consists of using Headers, Footers, Nav, Article, Section, Aside and Figure tags. If you want a healthy growing web page, you shouldprobably use these.

	*Headers and Footers are exactly what they sound like. If you seriously don't know what these are, toy around with MS Word or look at a newspaper. Use these, instead of making Divs with a class of Header or Footer.

	*Nav is for main navigation, and not for navigation that isn't related to the main site layout and navigation.

	*Articles are for chunks that stand out by themselves, unless they're way too big. Then maybe use a Section to break them down - or contain Section tags within the Articles.

	*Asides seem to be for sidebar navigation. Figures are for things like pictures, and 'hey, look at me!'.

As an aside, I'd like to say that the example code in the book makes my eyes bleed, because they absolutely insist on bloating the HTML with styling.

##HTML Chapter 18

Or, why User Stories, Site Maps, and Wire Frames are your friend.

	*I think everything related to target audience, "who is using your site", and "what are they looking for" are all summarized in the concept of "User Story".

	*Site Maps are a cool idea we already use when planning out the visual layout of a page, but I'm motivated to try it out for CONTENT as well. I seriously want to get physical index cards, or find a program that effectively lets me make them when in the planning/brainstorming phase of design. Hopefully I get to have planning phases, rather than just starting to code things out?

	*Wireframes are minimalist representations of JUST THE INFORMATIONAL CONTENT of a website, but NONE of the design (looks). More specific than a Site Map (or maybe one wireframe per sitemap card?), less visually-oriented than a mock design.

	*Design is actually realy importnant, as this chapter tries to convince us. Prioritization and Organization of what you put in are the drums it beats really, really hard.

	*It uses pretty good examples of this - the Smithsonian website is actually very well done. This chapter uses the Smithsonian website to illustrate Visual Hierarchy, including ideas of contrast, grouping and similarity. Things it does very well, and efficiently. The site looks sharp. Size, color, and style allow you to contrast different parts of a page effectively.

##JavaScript Chapter1

Wow wow wow wow this chapter is filled with bloat! I don't need all these diagrams and pictures! You aren't even saying anything yet!!!

	*I already understand what a Script is. Computers follow series of scripts, much like actors follow their sets of lines.

	*JavaScript has "Objects", which are one of the two organizing structures (the other one being functions). Objects have "methods", or functions that belong to them.

	*Events are triggers that will call these object methods when the user does something, or other scripts on the page do something.

	*Always link your JavaScript files in your script tags, kids.

There, that wasn't so hard. Jeebus, why did you need to take 40 pages to say that? I don't need a freaking "See-n-say JavaScript".

The event goes, "Click!"
