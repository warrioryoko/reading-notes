I don't have especially good project ideas.

There were a few food APIs, that could let the user search for meal/food recipes. I could have a feature that generated a random taco from one API, with a random cocktail from another API, and displayed the recipes for them both.

The NASA API has geolocation APIs for weather on Mars, as well as Mars Rover image and video. I'd love to make an app lets users search Mars site images.
