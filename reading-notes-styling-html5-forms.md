There are 6 videos I watched, from 'The Net Ninja' on Styling HTML 5 Forms #1-6: Introduction, Styling Radio Buttons, Styling Checkboxes, Styling Text Inputs, Styling Select Boxs, Validation Styles.

Well, I watched them. Actually getting time to style once I've gotten something working, though, is a different matter.

It feels like this is the answer to the wrong questiong for me, right now.
