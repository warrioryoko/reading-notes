Wow.

Well then, that was a history lesson.

And I mean, it was a history lesson, not a "how do I use this" lesson.

Local Storage lets us use cross-browser, cross-platform storage, so I'm definitely not knocking it. That's a major accomplishment from where we came from.

It gives us access to key/value pairs that are stored entirely as a string, only. So parsing or stringifying it is going to be a bit of a pain.

But that is infinitely better than having an embedded mini-SQL database, like /\/\icro$haft's 'Gears' idea.
