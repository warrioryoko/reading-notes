Objects

What I got out of this, is the shortened notation.

I'm also getting that square bracket notation is important, but I'm not getting the key notation tests to work. Or, understand what I'm even supposed to be getting out of this.

Everything else doesn't make sense, and the language/wording/lack of wording in the tests make it EXTREMELY difficult to understand exactly what I am supposed to change. Half of the time, it's extremely difficult to discern what I was supposed to learn or understand even when I can get the test to work.

Classes

Not loving anything about classes.

Inheritance is the devil, and I probably don't want to write my own class implementations, only extend them and make use of their methods when using libararies.

I dislike everything about using Static. I concede it could be useful as a way to organize related methods? But then, you have to write a class to do that? Why?

Destructuring

No. I don't get it. All of this seems to toe a thin line between condensing code to be succinct, and making it incomprehensible garbage. No, I'm not understanding how it works. No, I don't understand all of the syntax. No, I was not able to get all of the tests to run.

Was I supposed to?

*sadface*

Rest

Similar to 'arguments', but only applies to the remaining items in a list rather than the entire list. Catch all of the things that are left.

I understand the concept, but god I am probably NEVER going to write code that uses it. I makes everything so unreadable to me, and I don't understand half of the test use cases.

Spread

This was the most understandable out of everything.

Most of everything else in the repl tests mostly seemed like nonsense to me.

Function Defaults

Functions need to be given defaults when performing mutations/calculations, or we're going to get undefined, NaN, etc.

Check.
